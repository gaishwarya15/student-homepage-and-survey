# Department Survey Website â€” Static Web Project Overview

This project showcases a personalized student homepage and a department portal featuring an interactive survey form.

The department section presents an overview of graduate degree offerings and highlights sample courses through structured content and tabular formatting. The survey page enables prospective students to provide feedback through a form that includes input validation, autocomplete support, placeholders and semantic grouping of fields.
